        <p class="bio-text">Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was <em>the first</em> to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and created the <em>first algorithm</em> intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and <strong>the first computer programmer</strong>.</p>
